  <h1>Basically, I'm Showing Off My <i>Deck</i></h1>
  <div class="plate">

    <h2><strong>Page Summary:</strong></h2>
    <p><span style="color: antiquewhite;  font-size: 25; ">
        I'm showing off and explaining some of my favorite cards from my game. IDK if its crazy how attached I am to
        some of these cards but I've stared at them for so long so
        <em>cope</em>. I want this page to be like an archive of all my favorite cards and where more details about them
        can be found.
      </span> </p>


    <h2><strong>Card Overview</strong></h2>

    <p><span style="color: antiquewhite;  font-size: 22; "> All of the cards are from my version of the game
        "chesticuffs" that I am developing. These are assests for the digital and physical versions of the game.
        I made them myself and I love them very much. Some of the concepts of the cards were thought up with my friends
        and have the silliest backstory. Like one card is called <em>"Newton's Apple"</em>.
        Its whole Idea is that it adds graviity to another card so it can't attack as much. Its ideas like that that
        could be turned into cards.</span> </p>

    <h2><strong>Motivations</strong></h2>

    <p><span style="color: antiquewhite;  font-size: 22; ">I just wanted an exuse to combine Minecraft and card games. I
        like playing cards because it's a really fun way to be idle. I usually prefer
        casino games, but I couldn't figure out how to make a poker version of Minecraft so I settled for something
        different. <em>I might come back to that thought though because it sounds funny.</em>
      </span></p>

    <p> <span style="color: antiquewhite;  font-size: 18"> <em> This first group of cards was the first one I developed
          and/or designed and planned for and got attached to. Featuring the plant types, a character card, and the back
          of all the regular playing cards. </em> </span>
