      <h3>UXN Analysis</h3>
      <p>UXN is basically a operating system emulator inside a small virtual machine. Its purpose
        is to emulate the operating systems' commands and widgets that usually require some level of
        internet access in an offline space. The way the UXN is designed allows people to pull it
        up on a variety of devices not just a desktop and it works like an old game emulator that loads
        game roms, just instead of just games it can load things like digital clocks that have been
        converted to rom format.
      </p>
       
      <p>The concept of the project prefectly describes what it felt like when I was messing around with the different available roms.
        It felt like I opened an old window from an old computer to load a program. I couldn't try it offline
        so I don't know how that aspect of the project feels but from my experience so far I think the 
        emulation aspect works great. 
      </p>

      <h4>What about the concept do you find compelling?</h4>
      <p>The concept in general is very compelling because its the offline
        internet that my chronically online self has always wanted when I was younger and the internet
        would just shut off. I like the idea that I could load the copies of web pages or things that
        I like if I can figure out how to rom it and run it through this system.
      </p>

      <h4>What are your critiques of the platform/project?</h4>
      <p>I feel like I haven't used it enough to make valid critiques yet. For what I have used 
        and seen the platform works as intended and can be malleable enough for people to adapt what 
        they need to adapt to the platform to run it. Honestly I'm not sure of the limits of 
        the program but the only limit I've seen so far is the graphics and even then I like classic
        computer icons and graphics so its not a real detriment to the project. Overall review is 10/10
        from me.
      </p>
      <h4>What alterations would you make to this software?</h4>
      <p>If I had the paitience the only thing I would change was how easy it is to load the roms and 
        use them in a browser. I've only used it in a browser at this point and the only thing I didn't 
        enjoy was constantly opening my files to pull up the rom to drag it into the browser. I 
        would try to make like an in browser library for the roms or something. Like a extension that 
        automatically pulls the rom folder so I just have to choose from there from inside the browser
        instead of using the console line or opening the files. But otherwise I had a great time using 
        the roms that worked as intended. I hope to be able to load this on my DS or some other console
        at some point.

      <h3>Presentation Summary</h3>
      <p>One of the topics we went over today was emulation as seen in video games like Pokemon.
        We discussed how emulation is a lot quicker and more effective than trying to adapt an older
        game to a newer device and the problems it avoids by going the emulation path. We also went
        over the Hundreds Rabbits emulation based operating system that can be run on anything that 
        can potentialing have internet access like a gameboy or 3Ds.
      </p>

      <p>The most important thing we learned from Alex in my opinion was about the open source software industry and 
        where people can start and go within it. They can either join public projects through sites
        like gitHub or kickstarter projects or join tech companies that focus on open source projects.
        There are a variety of jobs that use the skills that can be aquired from working in these 
        environments and with enough creativity many ways to apply it wherever necessary. For example
        learning different coding languages that can flow into others and could help someone gain 
        proficientcy in other tasks like how we learned the coding language GO is used at Twitch for many
        projects but the langauge itself can be developed and learned with knowledge of similar 
        languages.
      </p>

      <p>The funniest and most interesting topic in my opinion was the discussion on the development on technology over
        time and how its somehow worse than the technology it was evolving from. The best example brought
        up to show the modern luddite's thought process was the typewriter and how effective it still is 
        for completeing its only function. I thought it was funny because it reminded me of the videos 
        where older generations (millenials) are watching people basically 5 years younger than them
        "rediscover" technology they grew up with, like blackberry phones and cassette tapes. And 
        we even went on to talk about how people have communities online to revive retro internet browsing
        methods and designs. This 
        discussion really just solidified the thoughts "if it's not broken don't fix it" and "one step
        forward a thousand steps back" in my mind. Because at the end of the day even if the step forward
        was the most optimal there are always going to be people left behind that prefer or require the 
        previous version more.
