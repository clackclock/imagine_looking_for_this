      <h3>What is the software? What does it do and who does it serve?</h3>
      <p>Created by the gitHub user <a href = "https://github.com/LucasHazardous/OpenSourceCasino/commits?author=LucasHazardous">LucasHazardous</a> and one other official contributor, this software is basically a non-profit casino that focuses on intuitive casino type games 
        and less on money making. There is in-game "currency" that gets linked to the user's browser
        but the project's main purpose is to "give you an insight why you should never think of a casino as a way to make money".
      </p>
      <p>This online casino serves people who enjoy playing casino games without the thrills and risks
        of chasing a reward. I started looking deeper into it because of how chill it sounded. While I
        enjoy the risk-reward stress system of traditional casinos, I do see the appeal in calmly enjoying the 
        games without having to risk your entire pay-check and/or life savings.

      </p>
      <a href = "https://github.com/LucasHazardous/OpenSourceCasino/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"> OpenSourceCasino Contributing Conduct</a>
      
      <h3>What is the license for the software? What is expected of contributors?</h3>
      <p> They use the GNU General Public License v3.0. Basically they belive in the copyLeft philosophy
        of "you can use my open source code and distribute it freely at your leisure, but you must provide the same 
        right and license to everyone after you". The "everyone after" being contributors, who seem to be randoms
        who joined to add their own games or modifications. The long and the short of contributing to this project
        seems to be; be respectful and if you want to add something to the official release make sure you have an understanding of
        the languages being used and are able to provide detailed descriptions of what it being changed with your updates.
        </p>
        <p>The project itself seems to be towards the end of it's life-cycle. With the most 
            recent update being a bug fix 8 months ago I would say the project is wrapping up. While I was playing on the site
            I noticed some placed where it could use adjustments and funny bugs. However, since it's purpose
            is to serve as a template and example of no-reward based gambling for what the site looks like and is
            able to do right now it can be considered complete.
        </p>

      <h3>What kind of help do they need?</h3>
      <p>If I were to contribute, it would probably be to just add more games or graphics. Looking 
        at their project as a whole they don't really need more help outside of bug fixes and maybe
        some "quality of life" or accessibility changes. 
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise this casino is proper functioning
        order and ready to be built upon by the masses as either a beacon of wealth or an educational
        resource for the recovering gambler.</p>
