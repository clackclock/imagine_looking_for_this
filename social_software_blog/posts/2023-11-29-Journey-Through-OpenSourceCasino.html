      <h3>Write a step by step procedure about your first steps taken.</h3> 
      <p>The first thing I did was consider what my interests were. If I was going to work on something I wanted to make sure it was something I would put work in for. I like gambling and casinos so I typed “gambling” and “open source” into github and found OpenSourceCasino by LucasHazardous. 
        I lurked around all the files I could find and understand and found that they were basically done with the project aside from minor tweaks here and there, but they were still accepting contributions so I decided to add to it.
        To get it working on my computer I lurked through all of the contributing .md and read the README at least 50 times. Thus began my first challenge in actually understanding how to get the thing to work.  I could clone it just fine but actually testing it was the challenge because the git hook it used was very specific. After some tinkering I got it to work and went to figure out what I wanted to add and what I could add. 
        </p>
      <h3>What community are you working in?</h3>
      <p>From what I understand its like a mix of the casual gambling and browser game developer communities. It just has a few people but they’ve meshed their ideas together in a very unique way. Gamblers usually stick to the gacha or more casino like side of games and browser specialists make games that are very low budget and simple so they don’t always include fun chance functions that a risk taker likes. But this group seems to have merged  their interests very nicely.
        What additional info did you find in your research?
        I found out about new casino card games and the fluctuation of win rates between the top 10 best games in my research as well as different winning strategies that would definitely take too long to code.  I also learned more about json files and vue along with new command line techniques while figuring out how to clone the game from the command line.
        </p>
      <h3>How do you see yourself contributing?</h3>
      <p>My first idea was to add the casino game Casino War which is basically Declare War with gambling. They already had card assets on site so I really just needed to copy and paste and be done. My second idea was mostly to help myself out. Because of the “casino lighting” vibes they designed their site with it was very hard to see the cards sometimes so I wanted to add a border to the cards so that they would be more visible. The idea that I’m definitely going to do is add a markdown file explaining the framework they decided to use because if it took me a long time to sort it out it will definitely take other people at my skill level a while too so I wanted to help other future contributors add to the project.
    </p>
      <h3>What roadblocks, questions or concerns do you have?</h3>
      <p>So far my only problems are coding in VUE.js and figuring out how to rework the Husky git hooks again but once I re-do it it shouldn’t be too bad. I might open a discussion about the husky git hook though because of how annoying it is.
    </p>
    <h3>What will your next steps be?</h3>
      <p>Figuring out how to rework the BlackJack.VUE into Casino War and add a lining to the cards. To be honest adding a border will probably be the easiest part, so I’ll do that part first.
