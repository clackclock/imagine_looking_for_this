      <h3> Pre-Interview Questions</h3>

      <p>Social media was seemingly built from ill intentions. The main factors that are negatively
        affecting people are the subtle addictive qualities that gradually take over a person's day to day life,
        and the unhealthy environment being produced by the big business's manufacturing and nurturing the worst in
        others.
      </p>
      <p>Fixing social media would need the businesses in control to re-wire their way of thinking about their
        consumers.
        Personally I would say it's mostly impossible only because it hard to remove the "must earn money" mentality
        from big businesses that want to get
        bigger, but a possible solution would be removing the algorithms based around learning about a person and the
        "pay to win" features most social
        apps have. These features are usually the go to example when talking about how something has created a toxic
        environment
        for consumers. For example, Instagram sets itself up to send photos and reels that appeal to the user to the
        user's opening page and
        advertises and encourages users to pay to "boost" or promote their posts for the illusion of gaining more
        positive feedback through likes. And in
        recent updates photos have been nearly nonexistance with the boost in popularity to short form video posts,
        which has caused many content
        creators on the platform to start posting videos of their pictures to get any traction at all, which in a lot of
        cases leads to a downward spiral
        with unmotivation leading to demoralization, depression, etc, until eventually they either stop using the app or
        use to channel the built up bitter emotions.
      </p>
      <p>It is instances like this that make me think that social media is impossible to reform, but the reason I said
        "mostly" above is because I have seen platforms
        that have removed these features. Most are privately owned like the Special.fish, but I have seem some
        mainstream platforms almost achieve this before being taken over.
        A personal favorite is Tumblr, which is basically a blog forum site. It has a for-you page like most social
        media where things can be suggested to you, but for the most part this page is made
        for you and by you from your own input. A few years ago the site was bought out by Yahoo, but for the most part
        the app has maintained most of it's charm of not actively trying to brainwash it's
        users and making fun of mainstream social media features, like people paying for Twitter checkmarks. And the
        community
        is mostly made up of people who work to keep the environment as non-toxic as possible and maintain the charming
        aspects I mentioned.
        Overall, I believe that social media is something can be reformed for people and society to enjoy and benefit
        from if the platform can be allowed to
        exist without big business input and given a chance to grow with a community that likes it's features and
        actually wants to work together to maintain
        itself instead of feeding the machine of bad ideas and "pay to win" functions.

      <h3>Post Interview Questions</h3>
      <p>I believe in Jaron's argument because I've seen so many examples of what he's talking about. I've seen the
        depressive spirals people
        manage to get into and the inexplicable addictions to intangible feedback and people. I've lived through
        elections and presidentcies that have been
        dramatically effected by anonoymous commenters. Something's going to give. However I can confidently say
        something is being done about it, because all of us have
        seen the reports from people talking about how unhealthy social media is, and the alternative posting websites
        people have made to alleviate the stress of big business social medias
        and the small changes that get passed when enough people ban together to make a difference. I think if there
        going to
        be any lasting change it is going to be through a community effort, and it has to be otherwise nothing will get
        done.
