            <h3>Small Social Networks</h3>
            <p>I have been in a Discord server with my friends from middle school since around 2017. So
                around 6 years of talking to the same 5 - 6 people to organize meet-ups, watch parties, or
                just share memes. The server was made by our main "chat maker" so he is the one who gets
                to decide who is let into the server or not. While me and other friends have permissions to
                share the private link to the server we usually just let him decide when to let others in.
                We didn't limit the link rate but I'm pretty sure we've only shared one link between us.
            </p>

            <h3>Differences Between 'Platforms' and a Shared Computer Server</h3>
            <p>One of the differences I noticed while using the open shared computer server is how
                "customizable" it is. Apps like Discord hava a customize option with bots and connecting servers
                to games and such but the tilde spaces have the option to connect it directly to the space and
                make it more akin to a arcade if you want than just a public social server with games visible or
                added on the side. And there can be other added programs like the various weather apps and user made
                functions that add to the customization for not just the server but for individual users.
            </p>
            <p>Another difference I noticed is how "mixed up" everything is. For example things like FaceBook
                and Instagram have the chat and game and private messages seperated and while there are ways to
                trigger the seperate functions they can still get mixed into each other. That's where my earlier
                comparison to an arcade came from, because its like being in a common area where there is
                regulations and such but things still manage to overlap anyway.
            </p>

            <h3>Three(3) Shared Computer Server Program Examples</h3>
            <h4>Micro</h4>
            <p>"Micro" is the file editor similar to "nano" but with a more modern keybind set up
                in the command line. You can use it to edit the same files as nano, like text files,
                '.sh' files and the empty documents that can be made with the 'touch' command and more.
                Once you put micro and the name of the file you want to open in the command line it opens
                to the text editor screen and then you can decide what the file's purpose can be. Personally,
                a strength is the easier to understand keybinds and menu, but it is weakened by how the key list
                is hiddened until pulled up with a keybind you need to look for. Otherwise I prefer micro to nano.
            </p>
            <h4>Tetris.brs</h4>
            <p>Within the Social Science server the program Tetris is a simplified Tetris for the command line.
                It has similar animations to a tetris coded with a GUI and can return the points like an
                arcade screen in a server with the list of rankings of where everyone who played has placed. The
                controls
                have been simplified to three buttons but that doesn't have much effect on the game play. A
                strength with the program in how it's been simplified to suit the command line which in turn makes
                it easier to concentrate on playing. A very noticable weakness is the input delay on moving the block.
                It was almost like you could feel the block stutter when moving after pressing the button. I don't know
                if it was just my computer or not so I don't know how it could be fixed, but that was the only weakness
                I found with the program, so otherwise it was very fun to play.
            </p>
            <h4>Ansi-Weather</h4>
            <p>The purpose, as can be seen by the name, is to tell the weather of a location. The program
                itself is meant to find the computer's location and return the location's local weather report.
                It is possible to change/ pick a specific location and decide exactly what weather information
                is returned. For example, whether the temperature is returned in imperial or metric, if there is
                a "real feel" option or not, etc. The strengths are in the levels of specificity the user can get
                from the program. Noticable weaknesses is the need to adjust the program to find your location
                when under certain circumstances the program can't find it. I like it for it how specific you can
                get with the command and the graphics the output returns with, so I feel the downsides get balanced out
                for me and
                my preferences.
