      <a href = "https://github.com/clackclock/banba_timer_game">Repository Game Link</a>

      <p>The repository is an old p5.js project I did in computer science I.
        Its just a mouse game where the player avoids falling objects until the
        timer stops. The timer is represented by a 3D banana that rotates and slowly changes
        color, from green to yellow. The player has three hit points and the game has 
        three game modes. Easy (baby), hard, and spicy. Baby mode is the regular
        game mode, hard speeds things up and spicy rotates the screen.

      <p>While I am very proud of the memes I made and work I did in this project
        I want to give this to people to do what they want with it completely 
        independent of me and my original concept if necessary. That's why I used the
        "Do What the Fuck You Want Public Lisence", because I want people to use
        this as a template and vessel for their own memes without refering to me. When 
        I was looking at the other lisences I noticed that in their own way they had 
        restrictions that didn't really appeal to the vision I had uploading this particular
        project. This is literally a javascript banana rotating on a screen with the 
        BANANABIS ROTATO audio playing in the background. Nobody should have to refer
        back to it or be contained to follow its example if they know they can make something
        even better given a bit more freedom, so I wanted to make it clear
        how much freedom the editor was getting if they decided to use the
        repository. Also the title of the license is very funny.
